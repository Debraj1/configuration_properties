msg:  Damodar River (Pron: /ˈdʌmoˌdaː/) is a river flowing across the Indian states of Jharkhand and West Bengal. The valley is rich in mineral resources and is home to large-scale mining and industrial activity. It was also known as the Sorrow of Bengal[2] because of its ravaging floods in the plains of West Bengal. The construction of several dams on the Damodar and its tributaries has helped control some of the flooding.
